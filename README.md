# PixelGameEngineCSharp
This is a C# port of the One Lone Coder Pixel Game Engine

# What is it?
A Port of the olcPixelGameEngine into the C# programming language. Now we use 
.Net Core instead of .Net Framework to maximize usability on other platforms. This also
decreases runtime by alittle bit.

# Original
The C++ version can be found here: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine

# What is Required?
You will need the Net Core version of OpenTK to allow the engine to use OpenGL functions and
you will also need the Net Core version of the System.Drawing library. Both of these can be retrieved straight
from your IDE if you are using visual studio or visual studio code.
